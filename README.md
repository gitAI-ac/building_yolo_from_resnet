 + Used Resnet50 as feature extractor which was originally trained on imagenet dataset
 + The dataset used is a publicly available dataset (Udacity Self driving dataset) available on Roboflow
 + Used grid size of (5,5) and no of anchor boxes each grid is 5 
 + trained to detect only two classes Pedestrian and Cars
